Git Tutorial :)

Step 1: 
git clone http://jira.caslab.queensu.ca:7990/scm/cp/cmpe320-team12.git
- username is your student netid
-password is your Jira password
Cloning will make a local copy of the repository on your computer 

Step 2: 
open your terminal and go to the repository 
(a folder on your computer called cmpe20-team12
Command : cd ./cmpe320-team12/

Step 3:
git checkout -b meanful_branch_name
git status to make sure you are on your branch
Don't work on the master branch, always make a new branch 

Step 4: 
Edit, add files, do any change in the folder

Step 5: 
Add your changes using: git add --all
This moves your files to the staging area

Step 6:
git commit -m “some explanation here”
Commit your changes 
This adds changes to the local repository

Step 7: 
Push you changes to the remote repository (shared with everyone)
git push origin -u meanful_branch_name

Step 8:
Go to Bitbucket and make a pull request so people can approve your changes before you merge into the master branch 


EXTRA:
To check the status or to check on what branch you are: git status 
To update your local repository with new changes from the remote repo: git pull
When you merge your branch into the master branch (after pull request is approved) then you either delete your branch or you update it (git pull)
If you delete your branch you can just make a new one
**Make sure you don't work directly in the master branch
